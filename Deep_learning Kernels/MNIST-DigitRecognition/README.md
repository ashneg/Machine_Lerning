This is based on **Keras Tensorflow Backend** 

**Dataset :**https://www.kaggle.com/scolianni/mnistasjpg

**Accuracy :** 98.87%( 1 Epoch)

            +99%(10 Epoch)

# Working
1. Extract the test.zip folder
1. Run the usingCNN.py


You can try any of the Kaggle Kernel for training the Data
**To increase your accuracy**


1)Either increase your layers on the hidden layers


2)Increas the number of epochs (but prevent overfitting)
